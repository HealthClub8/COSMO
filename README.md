COSMO Project Overview

The COSMO project began after my son asked me to build a **robot** for his granddad, who is disabled. In the UK alone, there are over 3 million people with similar conditions, yet the market lacks accessible and effective products to meet their needs. Seeing this gap, we started an open-source project to develop a small, user-friendly robot designed specifically to help my dad.

Currently, we have integrated a single core service called Streamer, which combines several key technologies:

    1. Chromecast - connected to old 40" TV -> for streaming content (check 'streamer' folder).
    2. Raspberry Pi - used as a 'streamer' to Chromecast (though any headless Linux Python executor could be substituted)
    KODI (OpenELEC) - selected to explore potential value from this integration, with the flexibility to replace it with another Linux-based solution or plain vanilla Linux in the future
